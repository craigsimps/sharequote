Highlight important content and allow users to easily share it with their network.

== Description ==

ShareQuote allows you to highlight important content from your posts or pages, and adds simple social sharing links beneath the ShareQuote content.

Wrap your ShareQuote content in the [sharequote] shortcode to highlight it. You can also set the alignment of your ShareQuote, with options for left or right available. If none is passed then the ShareQuote will span the entire width of the post container. For example:

[sharequote] Proin eget ipsum erat. Cras ultricies dolor at nulla tristique, at lacinia lorem iaculis. Nam at lobortis purus. Nulla luctus hendrerit finibus. [/sharequote]

Social sharing icons for Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn will be displayed under your ShareQuote content.

== Installation ==

1. Go to Plugins > Add New and search for "ShareQuote".
2. Click install, then activate.
3. With the plugin activated, use the [sharequote] shortcode to highlight your content.
